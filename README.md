# Super Shop Sales Analysis
### Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing sales, profit, and customer behavior in a super shop setting to uncover actionable insights and drive business growth.

### Key Features:
1. Excel Analysis:
   - Data cleaning and transformation using functions (e.g., `TRIM`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `VLOOKUP`).
   - Aggregation of sales, profit, and customer data using Pivot Tables.
   - Visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to depict trends.
   - Conditional formatting to highlight key metrics (e.g., top 10 customers, products with low sales).

2. Power BI Dashboard:
   - KPI Metrics: Real-time visualization of total sales, profit, and orders.
   - Regional Analysis: Interactive maps to identify high and low-performing regions.
   - Customer Insights: Analyzing buying patterns and frequency.
   - Product-Level Trends: Understanding which products/categories perform best.
   - Monthly and Yearly Trends: Identifying seasonality and growth patterns.

3. Advanced Features:
   - Drill-through reports for detailed insights.
   - Slicers and filters for interactivity.
   - DAX measures for custom calculations (e.g., YoY growth, profit margins).

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- Excel: Data preprocessing, pivot tables, and charts.
- Power BI: Interactive dashboards and advanced visualizations.
- Dataset Source: Super Shop Sales Dataset.

### Steps to Implement:
1. Data Cleaning (Excel):
   - Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format data for consistency.
   - Add calculated columns (e.g., profit margins, total sales per customer).

2. Data Modeling (Power BI):
   - Import cleaned data from Excel.
   - Create relationships between tables (if applicable).
   - Define DAX measures for metrics like total sales, total profit, and average order value.

3. Dashboard Design:
   - Design an intuitive layout with Power BI visuals (e.g., clustered bar charts, cards, and line graphs).
   - Include filters and slicers for easy navigation.
